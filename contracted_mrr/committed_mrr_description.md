Metric name: Committed Monthly Recurring Revenue (CMRR)
Owner: Finance Department of SRC Analytics  

## Business Definition (in plain English)  

### Committed Monthly Recurring Revenue  
Committed MRR represents the ongoing monthly revenue that the company is generating or expects to generate from existing customers, typically for services they are already receiving and have paid for. It often excludes contracts that havenâ€™t started billing yet. Committed MRR deals with revenue the company is actively earning, *without waiting on future billing cycles or contractual start dates*. CMRR takes into account the recurring revenue generated from existing subscription, new subscriptions, and expansion or upselling of existing subscription, while also accounting for contraction (downgrades or cancellations).  

For example, if a customer is actively using the SRC Analytics service and paying $10,000 per month for it, this amount contributes to the Committed MRR.

### Contracted Monthly Recurring Revenue  
Committed MRR should not be confused with Contracted MRR which refers to the monthly recurring revenue that is formally agreed upon in a contract between a company and its customer. The company expects to receive this revenue, based on the signed contract, and is counted even if the service has yet to be started.  

For example, if a customer signs a contract for a SaaS data analytics subscription of $10,000 per month starting next quarter, this $10,000 is considered Contracted MRR right when the contract is signed, regardless of when payments start.  

At present, SRC Analytics has not set up signing for contracts that will start in the future. When this change will be impelemented, Committedd MRR will be defined accordingly. 

## Business Purpose / Use Case  

Committed MRR is a key performance indication that gives a glimpse into the future for financial growth and stability based on current subscriptions the company has acquired. Financial team use it to assess the health of the recurring revenue stream, forecast future revenue, and maing strategic decisions related to customer acquisition, retention, and expansion efforts.  

Additionally, when compared the Committed MRR with Billed MRR and Collected MRR, it provides a comparison of what the organization should earn, how uch was actually billed, and how much amount was actually collected.  

For example, the CMRR for month of November 2026 is calculated as 
    Net MRR of October 2025 + 

## Calculation Logic / Formula  

The formula of CMRR is:  

    CMRR = Beginning of the month Net MRR + New MRR + Expansion MRR - Contraction MRR - Churn MRR
